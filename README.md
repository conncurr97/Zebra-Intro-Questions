Task 2- Continuous Integration

1.	Do people usually have set times and orders that they make their pull requests for the day? Does this help to alleviate peoples code interfering negatively with others on that team.
2.	Are pull requests first reviewed by the senior members on the team before the commits to the mainframe are committed? Or are they just checked by other Junior team members to make sure that the are compiling and working properly.
3.	Are most bugs caught by other members of the team, unit tests, senior members, etc. before the commits are made and the project is deployed, or is it common for bugs to sneak onto the main frame or even onto deployment? Is contiguous integration and peer review a large part in preventing as much of this as possible?
4.	Are there any major downsides to continuous integration? It is pretty evident to me that those pros seem to far outweigh the cons, but are there any major downsides (such as maybe being dependent on a team member getting their part of the work, and commits in on time?
5.	How exactly does the deployment pipeline work? Are multiple people committing at nearly the same time?


Task 3- Learn gRPC concepts

1.	How does the Protocol buffer complier differ from the standard Java complier?

2.	How are requests and Reponses created between different servers and stubs running different programming languages and frameworks,

3.	Do you need to setup a cross complier to compile these programs as they are being used with multiple programming languages? With this, how does debugging work?

4.	Is the connection and transfer of data between servers and stubs secure, or is there additional security measures that need to be taken?

5.	How does gRPC differ from, and how is it better than HTTPS?
